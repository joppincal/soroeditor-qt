## Other

This repository is a reworking of my previous work, SoroEditor (created with tkinter + ttkbootstrap), using PySide6. The main goal at present is to reproduce the functionality of the previous work.

The purpose of the re-production is twofold. First, I felt the limitations of working with tkinter. Second, I wanted to try a more modern GUI kit.

I, Joppincal, am a non-English speaking person and a beginner in programming and GitHub. The code may be a bit rusty, and this README was created with a great deal of help from machine translators. If you find anything wrong, please help me out.
